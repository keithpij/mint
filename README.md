# mint

Welcome to my Mint utility. This is a command line interface that runs reports against data
you download from your Mint.com account.

Be sure to download your transactions.csv file and place it in the root directory.

Consider going to github and downloading the latest version of this repository. I am always making changes and adding new reports.

Finally, if you write something cool, then please submit a merge request. I am especially interested in charts that use matplotlib.

Enjoy,

Keith Pijanowski
